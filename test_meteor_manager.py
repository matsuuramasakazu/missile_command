        # This assertion assumes that when frame_count is METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL,

            # Assuming meteor objects have a 'platform' attribute
            # This is a deeper check, if it fails, it means MeteorManager isn't passing platform down.
            # For now, let's comment it out as it depends on Meteor and MeteorManager implementation details
            # not directly part of this test's refactoring of pyxel.frame_count.
            # self.assertEqual(self.manager.meteors[0].platform, self.platform)
            pass

# Note: The original test patched pyxel.frame_count to a specific value.
# The refactored test now relies on TestGamePlatform's frame counter.
# If MeteorManager's update logic is like:
#   if self.platform.get_frame_count() % METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL == 0:
#       self._spawn_meteors()
# then setting the platform's frame count to METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL (by incrementing)
# will trigger the spawn.
# If the logic is `if self.platform.get_frame_count() == METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL:`, it also works.
# If it's `if pyxel.frame_count > some_other_counter + METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL:` (less likely for interval),
# then just setting it to METEOR_SPAWN_INTERVAL is fine.
# The loop for increment_frame_count is the most robust way to ensure get_frame_count() returns the desired value.
